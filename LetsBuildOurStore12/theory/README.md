### coding

- Pratices making a store, and slice and do read and write opertions using Redux Store
- Build Cart Flow using Redux Store

click the button it dispatch the action which call the reducer function which modified the slice of store( cart section) in store(how to write data)

we used selector to read the data
header component subscibing to the store

- utils -> appStore.js, cartSlice.js

- configureStore,cartSlice.js  === @reduxjs/toolkit
- Provider, useSelector, useDispatch  ==== react-redux
